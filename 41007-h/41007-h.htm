<h2>The Ku Klux Klan</h2>

<p class="p2">The great Ku Klux Klan sprang up like a mushroom,
a Southern organization formed in a time
when no other power in the world could have saved
the suffering South from the utter disorder which
prevailed during the awful period following the War
between the States.</p>

<p>The stigma attached to the name Ku Klux Klan
by the uninformed masses has, at this late day, been
practically removed, thanks to that Southern author,
Thomas J. Dixon, who through "The Clansman"
swayed public opinion the right way; and thanks
again to that master director, David W. Griffith,
another Southerner, who filmed this wonderful story
and set the people to exclaiming, "Why, the Ku
Klux Klan was a grand and noble order! It ranks
with the best."</p>

<p>Every clubhouse of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy should have a memorial tablet dedicated
to the Ku Klux Klan; that would be a monument
not to one man, but to five hundred and fifty
thousand men, to whom all Southerners owe a debt
of gratitude; for how our beloved Southland could
have survived that reign of terror is a big question.</p>

<p>The very name Ku Klux shows that the order was
formed among men of letters. It is a Greek word
meaning circle. Klan suggested itself; the name
complete in turn suggested mystery. Originally the
order was purely a social organization, formed in
Pulaski, Tennessee, May, 1866, and gave diversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to the restless young men after the reaction of war.
They found vast amusement in belonging to a club
which excited and baffled curiosity; great sport, too,
was found in initiating new members. But it was
when the Klan realized that it had a great, vital
work to perform that it rose majestically to the
gigantic task.</p>

<p>When the order at the end of a year had grown
throughout the South to such a size that a master
hand was needed to guide it, Nathan Bedford Forrest,
famous cavalry general of the Southern Army,
he of the charmed life, a man who was in "more
than one hundred battles and had twenty-seven
horses shot under him," a leader famous for his military
strategy, was elected Grand Wizard of the Invisible
Empire. Forrest always stressed the order
that no fighting would be allowed. If they needed
to fight they would throw off their disguise and fight
like soldiers. Their purpose was to scare into submission
the unruly free negroes and the trouble-making
carpetbaggers; and this purpose they accomplished,
without one drop of blood being shed,
except in the most extreme cases. Whenever an
undesirable citizen was not wanted, he generally
found a note tacked to his door saying that if he did
not move on within twenty-four hours he would be
visited by the Ku Klux Klan. Signed "K. K. K."
The man generally "moved on" long before the stipulated
time.</p>

<p>The negroes, being naturally superstitious and
imaginative, helped the order to gain power. In
Nashville, Tennessee, among the five dens, there was
one formed of medical students from the University.
One of the favorite pranks of these young doctors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
was to ask a negro to hold their horse, and then
place in his hand as he reached out to take the lines
a finger or a hand taken from a corpse. The negro
generally went a mile before he stopped running.
Another effective trick practiced by the Klan was,
when they had a negro on trial, to sprinkle beforehand
a little powder on the floor&mdash;"hell fire," they
called it&mdash;and when the negro would be looking
down at the floor one of the Klansmen would surreptitiously
run his foot over the powder line, and a
fiery-looking trail would show. The negro would
be paralyzed with fright, and was always careful in
the future never to have cause to be brought before
the Order again.</p>

<p>The Klan practiced numerous clever devices.
Fancy the impression made on a negro when a robed
Klansman asked him for a drink of water, to see a
whole pail go down without any effort (a rubber bag
concealed in the uniform aided in this deception),
and then to hear a sepulchral voice say, "This is the
first drink I have had since I was killed at Chickamauga!"</p>

<p>One never knew when nor where to expect a body
of Ku Klux; they would spring up out of the
ground, to all appearances; their ghostly figures
multiplying like magic; they had a manner of forming
their companies which made a band of one hundred
men appear like a thousand. Their horses'
feet were always muffled, making their approach
completely noiseless. But it was only the guilty
who feared them; and fear was what the Klan
worked to effect. To kill was not their aim, and
only where absolutely necessary was it ever resorted
to. A rare instance was that of the hanging of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Northern spy by the Pulaski Klan. This man came
to Pulaski and took up carpentry; he made the people
like him, and worked himself into the Klan; got
their pass-words, everything in fact that they knew;
then made ready to get away to the North and
expose the secrets of the Order. They found it out
before he got away, and when he boarded the train
in Pulaski, a number of the Klan boarded the car as
it turned out of the city, took the man off the train
and hung him at the bridge, thus saving their Order
a gigantic tragedy. It was never known who did it,
the government could find out nothing. The matter
was never discussed by any of the Klan, even long
years afterward.</p>

<p>In preparing this sketch of the Ku Klux Klan, I
have been most fortunate in having Capt. H. W.
Head, 9th Tennessee Regiment, now a popular physician
of Santa Ana, California, a former Grand
Cyclops of one of the Nashville dens, to draw upon
for material, and through his generosity in lending
me his treasured Prescript, which has never been out
of his possession since 1867, I am enabled to give
a verbatim copy of their secret oath and ritual.
When Mrs. S. E. F. Rose, Historian of the Mississippi
Division, wrote her interesting booklet on the
Ku Klux Klan, she was anxious to secure a copy of
this oath. She wrote to a lady in Tennessee who
had one in her possession and asked if she would, for
the sake of history, give her a copy. The lady
replied that she regretted not being able to comply
with her request, as she was not able to write it herself,
and prized it too highly to allow it out of her
possession for even an hour to have a typewritten
copy made. She said that her Ku Klux papers,
together with her husband's parole of honor obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
at Appomatox, Virginia, were to her treasures whose
price was far above rubies. So you see what a treasure
we have secured through Capt. Head's gallantry
and generosity. I am sure the Daughters appreciate
the interest he has taken in helping compile this
data. It was my aim to get information first-hand.</p>

<p>My father, Capt. James C. Cooper, was Grand
Cyclops of a den in Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee, but I
never saw his uniform, as it was burned when the
Klan disbanded. Capt. Head buried his uniform,
and thus saved it. He obliged me by posing for a
photograph in this interesting outfit. It was strange
how the old feeling came back to him. He felt, he
said, as if he were breaking his secret oath in thus
displaying his uniform. Certainly he did look guilty
and a little self-conscious as he emerged from the
funny-looking garment. The buttons you see so
generously distributed are made of tin; the cloth is
of black calico with white trimmings; the only color
used is a touch of red around the mouth and over the
eyes. A woman, who was sworn to secrecy, was
generally appointed by the dens to make their uniforms,
so that they would all be alike.</p>

<p>As in Masonry, no one was asked outright to join
the Klan. If a man happened to be talking to a Klansman
and showed a kindly interest in the Order and
a desire to join it, the Klansman would talk around
the subject, and if the man was of good character,
would suggest that they might find out something
about it, the Klansman hinting that he thought he
knew some one who belonged to it, and who might
get them into the Order. Capt. Head had a funny
experience with his own father. They were talking
one day about the new Order when the father asked:
"Do you know who these people are who call themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the Ku Klux Klan?" The son replied that he
might be able to take him to a place where they
could find out. At the next meeting of his den,
Capt. Head asked his father to go with him, an invitation
which was accepted. The old gentleman was
blindfolded and plied with the regulation questions,
all of which he answered satisfactorily. When the
blindfold was removed he was greatly surprised and
pleased to see two of his own sons members of the
den, Capt. Head himself taking his father into the
Order.</p>

<p>The Ku Klux Klan lasted for three years; they
disbanded as quietly and as quickly as they formed.
When martial law was declared, and the work was
done, Forrest sent out this order, through word of
mouth, from den to den, throughout the vast Empire:</p>

<p>"The Invisible Empire has accomplished the purpose
for which it was organized. Civil law now
affords ample protection to life, liberty and property;
robbery and lawlessness are no longer unrebuked;
the better elements of society are no longer
in dread for the safety of their property, their persons,
and their families. The Grand Wizard, being
invested with power to determine questions of paramount
importance, in the exercise of the power so
conferred, now declares the Invisible Empire and all
the subdivisions thereof dissolved and disbanded
forever."</p>

<p>Uniforms, oaths, and rituals were ordered burned,
because it meant death to a Klansman to have them
found in his possession, so strong had grown the
feeling against the Order, due to unscrupulous outsiders
who committed horrible deeds in the guise of
the Klan. But the grand old Order had accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
what it set out to do. Its work was nobly
done; and our rescued South still sings her gratitude
to her heaven-sent protectors, the mysterious
K. K. K.</p>

shall be held accountable in the same manner as if

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
